This is a library for working with data on the bit-level. The interface
looks pretty much like a ByteString, which is exactly what it is underneath.
This library also provides an alternative implementation of the BitGet
monad, as found in Data.Binary.Strict. However, this one is lazy, as is the
library in whole.
